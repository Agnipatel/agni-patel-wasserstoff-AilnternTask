## AI Pipeline for Image Segmentation and Object Analysis

**Overview**

This repository provides the source code and configuration files for an AI pipeline that performs image segmentation and object analysis. This pipeline can be used for tasks like:

* Identifying and segmenting objects in images (e.g., isolating buildings in satellite imagery)
* Counting objects in images
* Measuring objects in images

**Pipeline Stages**

The pipeline follows a modular workflow with these stages:

1. **Data Preprocessing**
    * Reads images from a specified directory.
    * Performs data augmentation (optional) to increase training data diversity.
    * Resizes images for consistent model input.
    * Normalizes pixel values (if necessary) for better training convergence.

2. **Model Training**
    * Loads a pre-trained deep learning model for image segmentation (e.g., U-Net, DeepLabV3+).
    * Defines the model architecture (if building a custom model).
    * Configures training parameters like learning rate, optimizer, and loss function.
    * Trains the model on a labeled dataset.
    * Tracks training progress and saves checkpoints.

3. **Model Evaluation**
    * Evaluates the trained model on a separate validation dataset.
    * Calculates metrics like Intersection over Union (IoU) for segmentation quality.
    * Visualizes segmentation results on sample images for qualitative assessment.

4. **Inference**
    * Loads the trained model for prediction.
    * Preprocesses new images for model input.
    * Performs segmentation on the new images.
    * Analyzes the segmented objects (e.g., counting, measuring).

5. **Deployment (Optional)**
    * (If desired) Packages the pipeline for deployment on a cloud platform (AWS SageMaker, Google Vertex AI) or as a local service.

**Requirements**

* Python 3.x (with recommended libraries: NumPy, pandas, OpenCV, TensorFlow/PyTorch)
* Deep learning framework (TensorFlow, PyTorch) with corresponding model library
* Dataset of labeled images for training and validation

**Getting Started**

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install the required dependencies (see `requirements.txt`).
3. Configure the pipeline settings in `config.py`:
    * Set data directories (input images, labels).
    * Define model and training parameters.
4. Run the pipeline script (e.g., `python main.py`).
